<hr>
This simple Integer Calculator is a quick app that I developed for Android to become more familiar with the Android SDK. I am in the midst of an Androird Development Curriculum and will develop a more polished app once my skills have improved. It uses a simple interface of where one enters two numbers, check what operations they want to be done upon the numbers, and obtain the results instantly on the bottom. It handles errors by issuing messages through "toast" like not entering numbers before solve and division by zero.
