Manoa The Gathering is my first Meteor application as a test of skills. It was also my first time in
adhering to Issue Driven Project Management practices that are commonly used through large software engineering
projects. It is a simulation of the official Magic: The Gathering Trading Card Game, but with card flavors centered around UH
Manoa instead. Using the power of Meteor's reactive collections, we successfully created a functional
chat room that normally would have required some SQL Database work to save messages. Meteor's ability
to achieve full stack web development with just basic javascript made it easy to set up server methods
to manage collections and publish them to clients on demand.

## The Chat Room

My contributions to this project was mostly front-end development. I was reponsible for the overall application design and layout, creating Semantic-Ui containers and combining all the functionalities together in a cohesive package. My teammates coded up the basic chat functionality and user authentication through the help of some tutorials.
