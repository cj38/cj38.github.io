What?! We need to run right? Nope. Let it come. Not like what we already know will help much anyways. This meteor is something else. Totally unique in its kind. Great opportunity to gather information on it. Meteor is a completely new approach to the internet's infrastructure. It may even be the successor of it, removing the need for AJAX and PHP. Maybe even SQL as well. Don't know what those are? Doesn't matter. Irrelevant if this Meteor is accepted. All you really need to know is Javascript. 

## What is Meteor
Meteor is a full package that allows the user to achieve full stack web development using only the basic HTML/CSS and Javascript. Front end developing is relatively simple and many know how to create basic webpages. The problem lies in the back end. Few know about server management and database structures. Meteor however, gives front end developers the power to create everything themselves. A special component of Meteor called Blaze assists with many of the heavy lifiting.

I didn't find Meteor to be completely mind blowing since I was only experienced in front end web development. No knowledge of back end material. I found it refreshing to be able to apply what I already knew to accomplish things I could have never done before. I did not know any PHP or SQL, and envied my friends that knew it. Now however, I can acheive the same results. It was very interesting how the server stuff is already taken care for you.
