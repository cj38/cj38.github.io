## What Configuration Management Refers To
Configuration Management is a crucial aspect of software engineering, especially because engineers usually work in teams instead of by themseleves. It usually refers to the well being of the entire coding project. The major branch of configuration management is version control. Back in 2005, the creator of the Linux kernel Linus Torvalds, created Git since the previous source control management (SCM) that was used to hold the Linux code became proprietary and there were no other free ones that met his standards. Git keeps all of the standard version control features one would expect to have and is now the most popular SCM options across the world.

## Version Control
Git is a local code manager that can keep track of all changes made to a project. Usually when one gets something working they would like to save it to make a backup copy before further development. Git takes care of this, which ensures that whatever they do next will not completely break what they have worked on before since they can always refer to the old versions and see a history of everything that was done. I've encountered this problem myself and have usually just made a copy of the coded file on my system manually to alleviate this problem. I have not worked on any large scale systems or large teams to where code collaboration becomes difficult since one doesn't know who changed what in where and how within a mass of files. In situations like these, a configuration managment tool will probably be very useful.

## GitHub
Other than personal management of where it can keep backup versions of your code, where Git really seems to shine is when multiple people need to work on a project, but cannot regularly meet up to work together. I haven't had the need for something like this yet, but I do see the utility of having something like Git. Having a dedicated domain to host your resouces online of where it can be accessed from anywhere is already convenient in itself. Then a team member can download a copy of your code, make some changes to it, and commit the changes to yours. The next time you view your own code, Git shows you all the changes that have been made and what files will be affected. This feature of keeping track of what has been modified and an option to accept or undo the changes made is the key aspect of using Git.
