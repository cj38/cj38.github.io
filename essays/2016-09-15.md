## What Configuration Management Refers To
Configuration Management is a crucial aspect of software engineering, especially because engineers usually work in teams instead of by themseleves. It usually refers to the well being of the entire coding project. The major branch of configuration management is version control. Back in 2005, the creator of the Linux kernel Linus Torvalds, created Git since the previous source control management (SCM) that was used to hold the Linux code became proprietary and there were no other free ones that met his standards. Git keeps all of the standard version control features one would expect to have and is now the most popular SCM options across the world.

## Version Control
Git is a local code manager that can keep track of all changes made to a project. Usually when one gets something working they would like to save it to make a backup copy before further development. Git takes care of this, which ensures that whatever they do next will not completely break what they have worked on before since they can always refer to the old versions and see a history of everything that was done. I've encountered this problem myself and have usually just made a copy of the coded file on my system manually to alleviate this problem. I have not worked on any large scale systems or large teams to where code collaboration becomes difficult since one doesn't know who changed what in where and how within a mass of files. In situations like these, a configuration managment tool will probably be very useful.

## GitHub
GitHub is the popular choice used in combination with Git. GitHub is an online cloud based software hosting platform. It gives developers a personal space of where they can upload their source coes and share it with a few select people, around the world, or with just oneself. Having a service of where one can access their code from anywhere and have a reliablle backup in case one's system goes under makes this a great choice. GitHub personal spaces can be created for free, with premium options for extra things like having more repository space. Although GitHub offers their own software with a nice GUI that can be used to interact with one's online repository, it also accepts standard Git commands from one's local Git program. This integration makes it easy to share code with others on top of the excellent version control Git already provides. I think that the creation of GitHub is what makes Git popular since the existence of a cloud based service helps immensely in software development. Yes, some sort of version control is usually a required thing in complex development, but having a dedicated space to share the results is what really matters. This way, more people can access the code with ease, rather than just having a local version management and send the code through some file sharing service.
