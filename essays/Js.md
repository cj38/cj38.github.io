## High-Speed Learning
After spending about 7 hours on the Javascript tutorials FreeCodeCamp within a few days, 
I dived into my first timed coding challenge using all out Javascript. If not for my strong C/C++ background
that I have developed in my previous engineering studies, I probably would have failed to complete it within the time
limit. <br>

However, once I watched the video solution of the problem, I found that although my implementation worked, it
was not the most efficient. I erased what I did and completed it much faster, using the more efficient method.
Subsequent coding challenges, referred to as Workouts of the Day (WOD), were much easier after having experienced
one already. They were not stressful and were relatively easy from an algorithmic perspective. I usually spent most of
my time debugging my implementation, finding that I mispelled some keywords here and there. Perhaps they will become more
useful when I begin to delve into more complex applications to really get my mind thinking.

## Opinions on Javascript
I am not a complete beginner to Javascript in the aspect of where I have used some basic scripting on some basic HTML
pages in the past. Nothing too complex, of where I only learned enough to get what I wanted to work such as altering 
content on mouse clicks. However that was a while ago, before Javascript ES6 and HTML5 was even released. The main new thing that I learned was about the "let" and "const" terms that are now preferred to be used over "var." I still have yet to look over the entire Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide to see what else new things are introduced in ES6.
