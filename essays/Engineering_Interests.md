Software Engineering has becomea great industry over the past decades and will only continue to grow as our technology continues to break new bounds of possibilities never possible before. It is the magical foundation that allows hardware to function in the ways we want to extend our own capabilities and accomplish a variety of tasks either more efficiently or more exceptionally without human intereference.

##The Art of Engineering
If resources were completely free and unlimited in terms of availability and power, engineering wouldn't be much of an issue. But obviously, idealities like this cannot be reached. Hardware limits such as form factors and energy sources, and software limits such as computing power and available memory will be pereptual bottlenecks. This is where the need for engineering arises. Apart from actual implementation and making things as error-free as possible, the right design and development techniques are needed to reduce the footprint of the final product as much as possible. Taking the smallest amount of resources possible to have your creation function, to give room for more features. 

###Optimization Doesn't Seem Like the Most Enjoyable Thing..?
Optimization is indeed one of the main tasks engineers are expected to do, but this is not what got me interested in the field.
