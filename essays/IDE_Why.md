## Code NOW or later
Integrated Development Environments. Why go through the trouble of setting one up and learning all the menu options
when you can just code instantly in JSFiddle?! I always used the built in vim that comes with the command shell to code all
my C/C++ programs. When I started diving into Javascript development, I was relieved that JSFiddle existed. You can do 
whatever you want in these editors. Sets up in a second or two, letting you focus on the real coding problem at hand.

Now with IDE's, its always the same process: Open. ... Do you want to start a new project? Yes. What kind of project? ...
Okay what would you like to name it? ... Where should it be saved? ... Now here is your codespace. Oh wait, you need to
make a file. What do you want to call it? !!!

## Okay, but what if you need multiple files? Open 20 JSFiddle/Vim windows?

For complex projects, then IDE's are definitely better yes. I remember having to make multiple shell windows and sizing all of them
so I could fit them in my screen. Or vim-ming in and out of files. In terms of starting out though, I feel that using a bare
editor and a compiler improves your skills in debugging programs.  It improves your ability to catch erroneous code yourself 
while coding instead of having an IDE highlight where all your errors are. Only when one is proficient in the language, can I 
then see the need for IDE's. You already know what you want and code completion can be very helpful. Beginners may just abuse
code templates and not even feel the need to remember everything. Type a few lettters, press ctrl-space and bam! Instantly 
there.
